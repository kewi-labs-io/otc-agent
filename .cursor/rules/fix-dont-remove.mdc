# Fix Problems - Never Remove Functionality

## Core Principle
**NEVER** reduce or remove existing functionality to work around a problem. **ALWAYS** fix the underlying issue properly.

## Rules

### When Encountering Errors or Issues
- **DO NOT** comment out problematic code
- **DO NOT** remove features that are "causing issues"
- **DO NOT** simplify complex logic to avoid dealing with edge cases
- **DO NOT** delete functionality to make something "work"
- **DO NOT** bypass validation or security checks

### Instead, You MUST
- Debug and understand the root cause
- Fix the actual problem in the code
- Preserve all existing features while resolving issues
- Enhance error handling rather than removing the feature
- Refactor if needed, but maintain all capabilities
- Add proper fixes that address the core issue

### Examples

❌ **WRONG**: "The payment processing is failing, so I'll remove it temporarily"
✅ **RIGHT**: Debug why payment processing fails and fix the integration

❌ **WRONG**: "This validation is causing errors, let me disable it"
✅ **RIGHT**: Fix the validation logic or the data causing validation to fail

❌ **WRONG**: "The WebSocket connection is unstable, I'll remove real-time features"
✅ **RIGHT**: Implement proper reconnection logic and error recovery

### Development Philosophy
Every feature exists for a reason. If it's broken, fix it. If it's complex, that complexity likely serves a purpose. Your job is to make everything work correctly, not to make it simpler by removing capabilities.
