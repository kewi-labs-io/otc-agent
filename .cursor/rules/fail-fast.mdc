## Fail-Fast Programming

- **Fail-fast, not defensive** - guard clauses, early returns; validate only at edges (I/O, HTTP, RPC, filesystem)
- **Avoid try/catch except at boundaries** - catch at entrypoints only; never catch just to log
- **Minimal nesting** - keep conditionals ≤2 levels deep; use early returns
- **Strong types** - rely on compile-time types, not runtime checks; no `any` or `unknown`

IMPORTANT: Always use an expect / throw pattern for any input to a function or constructor to verify that the input and output is what you expect it to be. This way we can catch bugs faster.

Always develop with the goal of writing code to minimize bugs and maximally validate our inputs, outputs and data.
